# The Rust Project

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these examples, don't forget to install [Rust locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and check out the [official docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/). Additionally for the curious, you can also check out the source code for this [site](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example).
